# My Shell Scripts

I use these scripts to automate the boring stuff I do.

## Scripts

- __frontend_me.sh__ - Creates skeleton folder structure for your frontend app.
- __css_me.sh__ - Adds my own css library to a directed directory.
- __python_me.sh__ - Creates skeleton folder structure for a python app.
- __git_update.sh__ - Updates all of the git repo's on the desktop.

## Set-up

- As you know most OS'es do not allow execution permission to scripts. So first
  we need to change the permissions:
  ```
  $ chmod <of the directory to executeable of all he files withinit>
  ```

## Usage

- `frontend_me.sh`:

- `css_me.sh`:

- `python_me.sh`:

- `git_update`:
