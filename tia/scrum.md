I am too lazy to open up a new board on trello for a small project like this, I will just note the necessary modules and their design info in this single file.

## Product Backlog

- [x] Command line ORM for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Command line ORM for SQLite
- [ ] Command line ORM for MongoDB
- [ ] Command Line ORM for Redis

## Design Aspect of ORM

- It is going to be extremely simple, basic CRUD options for the data and their containers. The only logic or lets say the complexity of the application will go to the READ (filtering) part of the ORM
