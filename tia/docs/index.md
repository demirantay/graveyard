Tia is a command line ORM for RDBMS(Postgresql, Mysql, Sqlite) and NoSQL databases (Mongodb, Redis). What is an ORM ? It is basically an application that lets you do operations on your database without having to write SQL query's. For this isntance instead of having the ORM as a module in a larger application like a framework (e.g. Django's ORM), `tia` lets you do the operations on the command line.
