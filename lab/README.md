I usually experiment with a lot of single file programs written in different kind of languages and whenever I binge clean all of my desktop I tend to (almost always) delete them and when I need them in the future, I have to re-read a lot of unneccessary documentation just to look at that piece of code.

Well, I got tired of doing it so from now on I am going to note the sccripts I think that are noteworthy in this repo.

## Script list

- `tip_calculator.py` -- Calculates the amount of tip you want to pay
- `fibonacci.py` -- Prints you out a array with fibonacci sequenced numbers
- `prime.py` -- Prints you prime numbers up to Nth number
- `floor_cover_cost.py` -- Calculates the amount of tiles and money needed to cover the floor.
