# Profile

This module contains the profile mechanisms for the average user. In this module the users can see their own profile's posts overview, saved photos, tagged photos and they can also see other peoples profile , tagged, saved photo overview.

They can also see their's and other users followers, followings, specific posts (with the posts comments ... etc.) and are able to follow and un-follow each other.

__Remember__: This is one of the core modules of the application. For example the help_centre module can be expandable but this module is not. The reason for that is because it has the main functionalities, such as follow, unfollow, post view, profile view ... etc.
