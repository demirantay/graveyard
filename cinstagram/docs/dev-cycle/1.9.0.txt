Move the static templates to the main application

Plan
----------

- [x] create dirs for all of the apps
- [x] craete neccessay files that will be moved to static and template later on
- [x] create views for all the pages
- [x] create blueprints and link them to the app.py
- [x] move the css statics
- [x] Move the htmls statics
- [x] fix static and template links  (img ... etc. not linking them together)
- [x] link all of templates with targeted viewss - (I have done it but stopped
      since some of the urls need to be modfiied in the guture with paramtetrs
      to their urls ... etc. there is no pratical need for this at the moment)
