# `Discuss`

- Programmer Panel is a god-mode panel that has the ultimate control over everything on the site. I can add stuff to control such as users, passwords .. usernames .. deleting posts and such but i am going to add an admin panel for that kind of low level administration.  However for programmer panel I am going to add stuff like ... latency analysis, graphs with kafka about the request amount, adding admins or deleting admins ... etc.
