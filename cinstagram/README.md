## Introduction

Cinstagram is a fully fledged Instagram clone. The support for IOS and Android will come in the future. Remember, this is just a educational clone and Instagram is a registered trademark of Instagram Inc. All of the static assets have been created by me and not copied from the Instagram Inc. I am just cloning the functionality of the site to improve my understanding of how large web applications work under the hood.

## License

I am purposefully choosing not to put a license on this project. I doubt Instagram Inc. will care for this project but I would like to stay safe :)
