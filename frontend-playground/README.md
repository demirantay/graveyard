# Frontend Playground

> Note: I do not like having too many unimportant projects on my github
 profile's repository list. That is why I create these "xx-container" repos to
 hold all of my un-important or un-maintained projects.

 From time to time I like designing new sites and templates with just html and css and a little bit of javascript for small fixes. Or create small snippets of code to play with javascript. Here is an index of all of them.

### Demo

You can visit the website here: https://demirantay.github.io/frontend-playground/

### License

The repository is MIT licensed do whatever you want with the code or the templates. If you just want to templates code look above and see how the folder structure is set up. Each templates main wrapper is named in their directory name. Just download that file and delete the rest.
