# Graveyard

Archive for my repo's that I am not maintaining anymore.

- `template_clone`  - This was my first project where I tried to develop a website template with responsivness. 

- `pomodoro_clock` - This was my first project where I used vanilla javascript for other than trivial tasks.

- `exchange_rate` - After learning about API's I tried to develop a trivial exchange rate converter for the terminal.

- `joky_jokes` - I wanted to learn python packaging, I kept this project since this was my first ever package. (im gonna                        delete it)
